If you haven't already, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to get started.

## Configure your environment [#configure-environment]

By default, if an account is created after November 2021, that account is placed in its own environment. This is the recommended setting. 

### What's stored in the environment? [#environment-detail]

<figcaption>
  Use the environment dropdown to see your cross-account applied intelligence activity.

* Your workflows configuration
* Your decisions configuration
* Your incidents
* Issues created from your incidents

Workflow enricher queries are executed at the environment account level.

### What's stored in the individual account? [#account-detail]

<img

<figcaption>
  Use the individual account dropdown to see policies, conditions, and destinations related to your account.

An individual account stores:

* Your policies and conditions
* Your destinations

When moving individual accounts from one environment to another, the configurations aren't deleted, but they may not be available in the new environment.

<Callout variant="important">
  To view an issue, a user must be authorized for read access to the incident intelligence environment.

To view an incident's details, a user must be authorized for read access to the account where the incident originated.

We recommend giving read access to all of your users in each incident intelligence environment.
</Callout>

### Create a custom environment [#create-environment]

As an administrator, complete these steps to create a new custom environment for the account your team is using. If you're not an New Relic administrator, you won't be able to complete these steps.

1. Create a [user key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys).
2. Go to [the NerdGraph explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). (If you're on an EU datacenter, use [EU NerdGraph](https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql).
3. In the account dropdown, select the user API key you created.
4. In the query builder, in the **mutation** section, click **incidentIntelligenceEnvironment**, then select **incidentIntelligenceEnvironmentCreateEnvironment**.
5. Click the execute query button or press **Ctrl+Enter** to create your environment account.

For more information on how to use the NerdGraph explorer, see [introduction to New Relic NerdGraph, our GraphQL API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).

The `incidentIntelligenceAccountId` parameter is the environment ID.

If you don't specify the `associatedAccountIds` parameter, all of your accounts are grouped into a single environment.
